                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Swann. I am a full-stack web developer in training, currently becoming certified through Georgia Tech's full-stack web development bootcamp in partnership with Trilogy Education Services. My prior education consists of a B.M. in Music Education from Kennesaw State University, whereafter I spent a year teaching orchestra and guitar classes. I am now working to expand my knowledge and skills through programming and web development. I enjoy problem-solving, assisting others, and challenging myself. I also enjoy reading science fiction, and am getting into the hobby of regular cardio and weightlifting! I look forward to hearing back from my future employer!</p>
