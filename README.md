# professional-portfolio

I had a fair amount of trouble with the css on this one. As of this README version, I have requested tutoring to help me go back and learn ways to touch up the css. Otherwise, the smooth scrolling is functional and specific for each anchor link. There is a visual interactivity with pictures, and the items under the "Work" section have functional embedded hyperlinks. This is one that is going to be an ongoing personal project, for sure!
